> 1. Cipher - The set of rules that are you are using to encode the information.
> 2. Caesar Cipher - Use a number to represent how many letters you shift in the alphabet.
> 3. Monoalphabetic Cipher - A class of ciphers where the whole code is based on one letter of the alphabet standing in for another letter consistently throughout the message.
> 4. Polyalphabetic Cipher - A cipher that uses substitution through the alphabet. Vigenere Cipher is a great example of this.
> 5. Vigenere Cipher - Using a keyword to encrypt a message into a caesar cipher. The only way to decrypt this is to know the key word.
